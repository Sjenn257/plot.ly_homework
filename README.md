# Plotly Homework

In this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the <b>Belly Button Biodiversity dataset</b> which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The samples show microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units or OTUs in patients studied.

# Method

Using javascript and the D3 library, I was able to read in the samples.json file that holds the data.

The main files are the app.js file with javascript coding and the index.html file to display the dashboard.

# Using the Dashboard

The drop-down box holds the IDs of the patients studied. Selecting a new ID will update the charts on the page.

The bar chart shows the top 10 OTUs found in that patient's belly button while the bubble chart shows all values found for the patient selected.

There is also a demographics box with qualities of the patient.
